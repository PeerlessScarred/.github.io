# About Me
- I am a mid twenties guy who is trying to learn as much as he can about tech despite starting later than most!
## My interests
- Reading - I read a lot. In 2024, I read just under 80 books over the course of the year. My favorite series is called Red Rising by [Pierce Brown](https://www.piercebrown.com/)
- Videogames - I don't have a lot of time to play games anymore, but when I do find a few spare minutes, I like to play [Helldivers 2](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/) and [Old School Runescape](https://oldschool.runescape.com/]. I have over 4,000 hours in OSRS.
## Websites I recommend
- [Red Rising](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15839976-red-rising) - This is the first book in the Red Rising series. Take a look!
- [Youtube University](https://www.youtube.com/) - I have learned a lot over the year from YouTube. Anything from building a computer to vehicle repair, YouTube has video documentation for many things people may want to learn.
